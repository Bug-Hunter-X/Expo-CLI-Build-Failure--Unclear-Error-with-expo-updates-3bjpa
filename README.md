# Expo CLI Build Failure: Unclear Error with expo-updates

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered during the build process of an Expo project using the expo-updates package. The build fails during production builds with a vague error message, while development builds succeed.  Solutions such as cache clearing and package reinstallation have been unsuccessful.

## Bug Report

The primary issue is the failure to build the application for production or release.  The development build works correctly, but the production build fails with an unclear error message related to `expo-updates`. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to build a production release using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.

## Expected Behavior

A successful build should generate the necessary files for distribution on the respective app stores.

## Actual Behavior

The build process fails with an error related to `expo-updates`, providing insufficient details to diagnose the problem effectively.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

The solution involved careful review of the `app.json` and `app.config.js` files, examining the expo-updates configuration, and identifying and resolving any potential conflicts between this package and other dependencies. In this example, a conflict with a custom build script was discovered and corrected.
