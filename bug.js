While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the expo-updates package.  The error message was vague, mentioning a failure during the update process but not providing specific details about the cause. The project built successfully in development mode but failed during the build process for production or release builds. I tried several solutions suggested in related issues on the Expo forums, such as clearing the cache and reinstalling packages, but none of these worked. The issue seems to be related to the way the update manifest is handled or potentially conflicts with another library or custom code in the project.
